Automating Real-World Tasks with Python

First, we'll take a closer look at how to use external Python modules to extend code's capabilities, and spend some time learning how to use documentation to learn a new module. For example, we'll use the Python Image Library (PIL) to create and modify images.

Next, we'll see how to communicate with the world outside of your code! We'll use data serialization to turn in-memory objects into messages that can be sent to other programs. Your program will send messages across the network to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by other programs. For those times when your code needs to talk to a person instead of a program, you'll also learn to send email messages.
